# Why Bonobo?
I created this static site generator because I hate complexity. I wanted to create the simplest and cleanest static site generator I could.
Bonobo is based off some design principles:
* No need to manually write html. Write Markdown instead.
* No need to write config files. Any metadata/configuration can be embedded into the markdown files
* Very clean and easy to read code. Bonobo tries to do everything in the simplest way possible. That's part of why Bonobo is written in C.

For this reason I think Bonobo is a great fit for many websites you may have to write.
